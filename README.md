# Website Portfolio - Gareth Fakouri

```
www.scruffweb.com
```
A project to develop a website that showcases my skills and experience utilising HTML and CSS learnt during the Coder Academy Fasttrack course.
## Ideas

Several areas of interest were considered as a possible basis for the website.

* Iraninan Caligraphy

* Cities lived in.

### Design Path

The choice was made to follow the abstract image path. It was felt that it would allow for more varied design decisions during the process. It was necessary to decide on whether the pattern should be ordered or random in nature.

* Ordered.

* Random.

```
The final design choice was abstract - random. This was made after some html/css mockups.
```

### Colours and Fonts

Possible Colours

* February Dreams

* Centro Reds

* Slicing Limes

* Patty Rabbit

```
The final colour choice made was February Dreams. Why? I liked it?
```

Possible Fonts

* Ubuntu

* Namum Gothic

* Nunito Sans

* Orkney

```
The font chosen was Orkney. They are all clean and modern however with a bit of experimentation the choice made proved slightly more pleasing than the other fonts.
```

## UX Design

* The goal for the desktop version is to stay on the same page and use the subject tiling system as the form of navigation. Information is provided by sliding panels which are opened by icon links. These are closed by a standardised exit icon.
* The mobile UX compresses the subject elements into a vertical stack utilising the same information slide panels as in the desktop version.
* The relevant subject matter is readily accessible to the user and is designed to be intuitive.
