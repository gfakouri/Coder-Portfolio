# Website Portfolio - Gareth Fakouri

```
www.scruffweb.com
```
A project to develop a website that showcases my skills and experience utilising HTML and CSS learnt during the Coder Academy Fasttrack course.
## Ideas

Several areas of interest were considered as a possible basis for the website.

* Iraninan Caligraphy

* Cities lived in.

* Abstract Images

### Design Path

The choice was made to follow the abstract image path. It was felt that it would allow for more varied design decisions during the process. It was necessary to decide on whether the pattern should be ordered or random in nature.

* Ordered.

* Random.

```
The final design choice was abstract - random. This was made after some html/css mockups.
```

### Colours and Fonts

Possible Colours

* February Dreams

* Centro Reds

* Slicing Limes

* Patty Rabbit

```
The final colour choice made was February Dreams. Why? I liked it?
```
The palettes were compared in desktop and mobile configuration layouts. The February Dreams had enough contrast to ensure the tile elements did not merge into each other.

Possible Fonts

* Ubuntu

* Namum Gothic

* Nunito Sans

* Orkney

```
The font chosen was Orkney. 
```
They are all clean and modern however with a bit of experimentation the choice made proved slightly more pleasing than the other fonts.

## UX Design

* The goal for the desktop version was to stay on the same page and use the subject tiling system as the form of navigation. Information was provided by sliding panels which are opened by icon links. These are closed by a standardised exit icon.
* The mobile UX compresses the subject elements into a vertical stack utilising the same information slide panels as in the desktop version. A key component was to maintain  a consistency of feel between the platforms.
* The intent was to make the relevant subject matter readily accessible to the user and designed to be intuitive.
* All links are opened in a new tab therefore the portfolio site is constantly loaded.

### Third Party Tools

Firebase was utilised to store the form data. A specific project links directly to the website without any need to utilise an email address embedded in the HTML.

An attempt was made to utlise the storage facility of Firebase to store and return data(cv) to the user. This proved less successful and is a work in progress. 

Web hosting was carried out by Netifly. 

The domain name was provided by goDaddy.

Fontawesome for the icons utilised.

Googlefonts for font selection.

### Testing

The website was initially tested on Google Chrome. It appeared stable in both the desktop and and mobile configurations. On Firefox there weren't any issues in either types of configuration. The testing on Safari was limited to a laptop so i am unsure of the outcome on a mobile. It was also tested on an Android tablet in Chrome and Firefox. Testing is an area that requires further investigation. 

## OUTCOMES

* The goal of this exercise was to gain an understanding of the creative and technical elements required to build a website. I believe i have gained valuable experience of the process required. A key element is that my technical skills don't necessarily match my creative side and therefore compromises had to be made with the end result. I envision that this will become less of a problem as i gain more experience and knowledge.
* The effective use of third party tools was a very positive experience and will allow greatly enhanced solutions in the future. It must be noted that it was not always effective such as with hosting data on Firebase for download. However i see this as a challenge to be overcome irrespective of the impact on this project.
* I found it necessary to utilise some Javascript to achieve certain effects. This has increased my understanding of the language and i was pleased to note patterns and structures that are present in other languages.
* Using git and github over the project has ensured that i have maintained a record of the portfolio, but has also improved my ability to use this system of version control.
* Overall the project has been a very positive experience and has consolidated the subjects studied so far.
